<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h3><p>The page or area describing the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h3>

<h4> Some of the risks regarding data breaches are far and wide, with implications not only effecting businesses, it even has the risk to effect children, as during COVID many schools in America switched to an online format of learning. This put attention into the cybersecurity around the very personal data around these children. As an example with the cited source, 99 data breaches occured resulting in the unauthorized access of 
  14,000 student records. Other risks include data that has been put out in the public domain which can put physical implications on students. Besides students, businesses can also be affected which has the knock on effect of a large loss of money and trust in a business, in most cases up to millions of dollars worth of damage can be done as well, besides businesses suffering, its also the consumers that suffer the most, with sensitive
financial information being leaked as well, leaving people open to financial harm and other forms of harm.   </h4>
